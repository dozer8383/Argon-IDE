This project was started from the need for a better and easier to use editor than the built-in TI-OS one. It is also acting, loosely, as a successor to Krypton IDE.

This is still in development. If you would like to try out the mock-up, go to the Releases page here, download the .8xp file, and send it to your TI-84 Plus CE.
